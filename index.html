<!-- History -->
<div class="container textcontainer">
<h1 class="neonTextTitle" id="history"> History</h1>
<p class="ms-4">
The city of Verín arose from a Roman villa, whose inhabitants could come from the "castro de Baronceli", 
located in the location currently occupied by the castle of Monterrey, built in the late Middle Ages.
During the Middle Ages the village lost its dominion and Monterrey centralized the territory and the life 
of the region around its counts and lords.</p>

    <img src="img/castle.jpg" class="mt-5 ms-4 cigarrons" >
   </div>
  <div class=" mt-2 col-sm-8 ms-4">
  </p>Verín became during the Middle Ages an agricultural and peaceful town, 
  although it was often involved in the warlike conflicts of the successive rulers of Monterrey, as well as the 
  border disputes between Spain and Portugal. In 1506, Philip the Fair held a meeting in the town with Cardinal 
  Cisneros in exchange for his mediation for the partial surrender of the troops of John III The Pious, King of Portugal.</p>
  
  <p>During the War of Independence, the castle became the scene of the last of its warlike conflicts since the execution 
  of countless hostile troops by garrotte vile took place in this environment.</p>
  
  <p>In 2019 the city council and the University of Vigo made public that they had found 
  in the castro das Quintas del pozo do Demo remains that "coincided with those of a medieval 
  fortification that could not be other than the castle of Cabreira", a fortress of the tenth century in the valley of Monterrey destroyed in the fifteenth century.

<!-- Carnival -->
<div class="container textcontainer" >
<h1 class="neonTextTitle" id="carnival">Carnival</h1>
<h2 class="ms-4">Where does this festivity came from?</h2>
<p class="ms-4">To know the Carnival of Verín as it is now, easily recognizable, we must go back to 1981, 
  when the popular festival resurfaces and, from that moment, is growing every day more and 
  more famous until today.</p>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="img/carnaval/cigarrons.jpg" class="cigarrons" >
       </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8 ms-4">
        <p>During all these years, even centuries, there is a character in Verín 
        that has never been absent, the cigarrón. It is assumed that this characterization comes 
        from the sixteenth century, when it was imitated and mocked in the village of a tax collector 
        especially unpopular among the Counts of Monterrei.</p> 
        <p>Today, it is customary in Verín to dress as the cigarróns, characterized by the painted mask 
        made of wood with a face with a mustache, cheeks and eyebrows highlighted showing a wide smile. 
        Among the clothing, the jacket, tie and white shirt stand out along with the chocas at the waist 
        and the whip in the hand.</p> 
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="ms-4">What happens now a days?</h2>
  <p class="ms-4">The festival begins on the so-called "Domingo de Corredoiro", with the sound of fireworks, 
  the charangas and the first concentration of cigarrones (masked men who run encouraging people to participate) 
  in the morning. That same day in the afternoon-evening, the first masked dance and the first "fariñada" are held in the main square. 
  However, the official beginning of the Carnival takes place on "Thursday of comadres", when the women leave the men at home and go out 
  to dinner in disguise; and when midnight arrives, a crowd takes to the streets to welcome the Carnival procession and listen to the proclamation 
  that gives way to the general fun. In this way, throughout the days of celebration, there will be flour battles, masked dances, parades of troupes 
  and brass bands, contests, tastings of typical products, etc... The most intense day is Sunday, since the Great Parade of Floats, Troupes, Masks and 
  Cigarrones takes place at noon.</p>
